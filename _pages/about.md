I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University.
My advisors are Professor Christos Faloutsos and Professor Leman Akoglu.
My research interests include graph mining, data mining and anomaly detection.
I am interested in solving real-world applications, and have been working on several projects with both academia and industry.
